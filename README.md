Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
1.  API implementations
2. and to further discuss further UI implementations to enhance the user experience

## Notes
I dont think I faced challenges beyond just learning the language. 
In the calculator app I felt I should have finished all the additional features, but 
this time around I decided to not worry about how far I got and I focused on really understanding 
the material. I was taking notes for all the videos and going slow through the material with the mindset
of being able to be able to work on our future app without following guides. I am pleased with my progress
and I am excited to keep expanding. :)
